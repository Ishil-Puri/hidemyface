# hidemyface
*By Ishil Puri*
> An iOS app that strips location metadata and blurs faces on static images to protect users' identities.

### Purpose
I've been on edge reading about the breaches of privacy whether that be cases like the infamous FB & Cambridge Analytica, ethically questionable projects like the recent Clearview AI, or the recent uses of facial rec tehcnology in protests.

With this project I was really interested in creating a tool for transparency and enabling people to be able to make an active decision in how we share our personal data, if at all. Hence, I believe to ensure accessibility, the best medium for this project is a lightweight and intuitive app.

I'll be adding more to this README, soon, to share my experience of developing the app â€“ including the details like the learning curve for Swift & Xcode as well as areas that were difficult and how I overcame them!

### Main frameworks used:
* VisionKit
* MapKit
* UIKit
